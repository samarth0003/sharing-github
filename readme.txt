hello,

In this project I have performed EDA and Feature Engineering on flights dataset 

I have used dummy encoding(get_dummies) ie a numeric variable that encodes categorical information

here: 1 encodes the presence of a category
	0 encodes the absence of a category

libraries used:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

I have visualized some correlations in
1)Duration of flights in india using histogram
2)Price and Source of Fights using catplot
3)How price of flight is influenced by number of stops inbetween using boxplots

If you have any suggestions, Please let me know.
